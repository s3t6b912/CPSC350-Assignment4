Assignment 3 - Queues and linked lists

References:
1. You for showing us how to make a linked list and queue

How to run:
Change to src directory
Type make in the command line to run
Then ./Assignment4.out filename, with filename being the command line argument being the file name and extension of the file being read

Notes on program:
1. Make sure the file you want to process is in the same directory as the .out file and that it is named correctly
2. I'm not entirely sure that the metrics I calculate in the program are what you were looking for, specifically for the window's metrics
because I wasn't sure if the longest time is supposed to represent the overall idle time of a window or just the most at a specific time.
3. My main function is a little bit of a mess so I tried my best to separate the code and lable what each block does
